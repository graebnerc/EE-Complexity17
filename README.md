# EE-Complexity17

This repository contains the accompanying code to the course "Complexity Economics - Theory and Computational Methods" taught during the Exploring Economics Summer Academy 2017.

The code is not yet complete and we will add some further code in the future, e.g. new solutions and some model examples.
