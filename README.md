# EE-Complexity17

This repository contains the accompanying code to the course "Complexity Economics - Theory and Computational Methods" taught during the Exploring Economics Summer Academy 2017.

The code is not yet complete and we will add some further code in the future, e.g. new solutions and some model examples.

The repository is structured as follows:

code_networks: folder containing the code related to the lectures on network theory

sol_lab_ABM 	Added new versions 	9 minutes ago

sol_lab_DYN 	Added new versions 	9 minutes ago

sol_lab_INTRO 	Added new versions 	9 minutes ago

test-complexity.py: the python file checking whether your computer is ready for the course
